# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this notebook, my aim is to get most recent bunch of tweets from twitter and clean strings, afterwards I did sentiment analysis on each tweet one by one and assign them some scores to decide positivity/negativity of it.

The data below scrabbed at 6th of July in 2021 and top 100 tweets were filtered with only contains BTC hash to give a short example.

Note : It is required to sign up with your own credientials as developer account to be able to wrap data through tweepy package. That is why I imported my credientials as a package called 'TwitterKeys' so I can use them to receive data through API.
