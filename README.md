# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this notebook, my aim is to get most recent bunch of tweets from twitter and clean strings, afterwards I did sentiment analysis on each tweet one by one and assign them some scores to decide positivity/negativity of it.

The data below scrabbed at 6th of July in 2021 and top 100 tweets were filtered with only contains BTC hash to give a short example.
